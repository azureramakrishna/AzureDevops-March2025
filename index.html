<h1>Introduction to AI Concepts</h1>

<h2>Generative AI</h2>
<p class="generative-ai">Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that can produce various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and audio. It uses machine learning models trained on vast amounts of data to generate new content based on input prompts. Examples include text-to-text models like language translators and text-to-image models like DALL-E.</p>

<h2>Prompt Engineering</h2>
<p class="prompt-engineering">Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts for generative AI models to achieve specific desired outputs. It involves crafting instructions, providing context, and specifying output formats to guide the AI's response. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for obtaining accurate and coherent results from AI models.</p>

<h2>AI Agents</h2>
<p class="ai-agents">AI agents are software programs that use artificial intelligence to perform tasks autonomously. They can interact with users, make decisions, and execute actions based on their programming and the data they are trained on. AI agents are often used in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
