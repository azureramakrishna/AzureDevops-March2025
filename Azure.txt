How many ways we can create azure resources:
- Azure Portal 

- Azure CLI 

    az login 
    az logout 

    az group list
    az group create --name rg-01 --location eastus
    az group delete -n rg-01 --yes

Azure Virtual Network (VNET):
    Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. An instance of the service (a virtual network) enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. These Azure resources include virtual machines (VMs).


Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

    saanvikit-eastus-dev-vm-01
2. The location where the resources are stored
3. The size of the virtual machine  (2vCPU and 8GB RAM) Standard_D2s_V3
4. The maximum number of virtual machines that can be created
5. The operating system that the virtual machine runs

    Linux server - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 
                   RHEL 8,9 
6. The configuration of the virtual machine after it starts
7. The related resources that the virtual machine needs
   - Data disk

Cold
Cool
Archive 

- Hot tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
- Cool tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
- Cold tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of 90 days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.
- Archive tier - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.


Lifecycle management rules:


Hosting static website

Azure file share

queues 

Table services 

Azure CDN (Content delivery network):
------------------------------------
A content delivery network is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. A content delivery network store cached content on edge servers in point of presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.



Azure Backup:
------------

The Azure Backup service provides simple, secure, and cost-effective solutions to back up your data and recover it from the Microsoft Azure cloud.

Backup types:
------------
- Full          Used for initial backup.    A full backup contains the entire data source. Takes more network bandwidth than differential or incremental backups.
- Differential  Not used by Azure Backup.   A differential backup stores the blocks that changed since the initial full backup.
- Incremental                               An incremental backup stores only the blocks of data that changed since the previous backup. 


Azure VM Backup:
---------------

During the first backup, a backup extension is installed on the VM if the VM is running.

For Windows VMs, the VMSnapshot extension is installed.
For Linux VMs, the VMSnapshotLinux extension is installed.


Azure Network connectivities:
----------------------------

1. VNET Peering (private connection)
    - Regional VNET Peering (VNET1 & VNET2 same region ex: EastUS)
    - Global VNET Peering (VNET1 EastUS & VNET2 Central India)

    **Pre-requisite:
        - IP Addresses should not overlap

2. VNET to VNET VPN 

3. Site to Site VPN (Public connection)

4. Express Route (Private connection) - ISP 

5. Point to site VPN

6. Azure Hub-spoke model

7. Network security groups (NSG):
    You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic between Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.
    
    Associated
        - Subnet
        - NIC (Network interface)

8. Private endpoint 
9. Service endpoint

VMSS (Virtual Machine scale set):
--------------------------------

    Auto scaling feature

    Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule


LoadBalancers:
-------------

- Azure LoadBalancers
    - Supports only HTTP 
    - Health probe: Health probes are used to check the status of a backend pool instance. If the health probe fails to get a response from a backend instance then no new connections will be sent to that backend instance until the health probe succeeds again.
    - Public / Private LoadBalancer
    - Backend Pool - VM / VMSS 
    - Regional / Global 
    - Loadbalancing / NAT rules 

- Application Gateway 
    Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications

    - Supports HTTP / HTTPS 
    - Includes WAF (Web application firewall)
    - Backend pool 
        - IP Address / FQDN (Fully qualified domain name)
        - VM 
        - VMSS 
        - App Services 
    - Path based routing 
    - Multi site hosting 
    - SSL Offloading 

- Traffic Manager 
    Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions.
    - Support only HTTP 
    
    The following traffic routing methods are available in Traffic Manager:

    - Priority: Select Priority routing when you want to have a primary service endpoint for all traffic. You can provide multiple backup endpoints in case the primary or one of the backup endpoints is unavailable.
    - Weighted: Select Weighted routing when you want to distribute traffic across a set of endpoints based on their weight. Set the weight the same to distribute evenly across all endpoints.
    - Performance: Select Performance routing when you have endpoints in different geographic locations and you want end users to use the "closest" endpoint for the lowest network latency.
    - Geographic: Select Geographic routing to direct users to specific endpoints (Azure, External, or Nested) based on where their DNS queries originate from geographically. With this routing method, it enables you to be in compliance with scenarios such as data sovereignty mandates, localization of content & user experience and measuring traffic from different regions.
    - Multivalue: Select MultiValue for Traffic Manager profiles that can only have IPv4/IPv6 addresses as endpoints. When a query is received for this profile, all healthy endpoints are returned.
    - Subnet: Select Subnet traffic-routing method to map sets of end-user IP address ranges to a specific endpoint. When a request is received, the endpoint returned will be the one mapped for that request’s source IP address.
