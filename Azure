What is ARM (Azure Resource Manager):

Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that helps you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account

How many ways we can create azure resources:
- Azure Portal 

- Azure CLI 

    az login 
    az logout 

    az group list
    az group create --name rg-01 --location eastus
    az group delete -n rg-01 --yes

- Azure PowerShell
    Login-AzAccount / Connect-AzAccount
    Logout-AzAccount / Disconnect-AzAccount

    Get-AzResourceGroup
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name "rg-01" -Location "eastus"
    remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "rg-01" -Force

Azure Virtual Network (VNET):
    Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. An instance of the service (a virtual network) enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. These Azure resources include virtual machines (VMs).


Azure Virtual Machine (VM):
--------------------------

Onprem - Server 
Azure - VM 
AWS - Instance
VMWare - VM

What do I need to think about before creating a virtual machine?

1. The names of your resources
    <project>-<region>-<environemnt>-<resourcetype>-##
    saanvikit-eastus-dev-vm-01
2. The location where the resources are stored
3. The size of the virtual machine  (2vCPU and 8GB RAM) Standard_D2s_V3
4. The maximum number of virtual machines that can be created
5. The operating system that the virtual machine runs
    Windows server - Windows server 2022 
                     Windows server 2019
                     Windows server 2016

    Linux server - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 
                   RHEL 8,9 
6. The configuration of the virtual machine after it starts
7. The related resources that the virtual machine needs
   - Data disk

OS DIsk:

Windows VM - 127 GB
Linux VM - 30 GB

Access tiers:
------------
Hot 
Cold
Cool
Archive 

- Hot tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
- Cool tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
- Cold tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of 90 days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.
- Archive tier - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.


Lifecycle management rules:


Hosting static website

Azure file share

queues 

Table services 

Azure CDN (Content delivery network):
------------------------------------
A content delivery network is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. A content delivery network store cached content on edge servers in point of presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.



Azure Backup:
------------

The Azure Backup service provides simple, secure, and cost-effective solutions to back up your data and recover it from the Microsoft Azure cloud.

Backup types:
------------
- Full          Used for initial backup.    A full backup contains the entire data source. Takes more network bandwidth than differential or incremental backups.
- Differential  Not used by Azure Backup.   A differential backup stores the blocks that changed since the initial full backup.
- Incremental                               An incremental backup stores only the blocks of data that changed since the previous backup. 


Azure VM Backup:
---------------

During the first backup, a backup extension is installed on the VM if the VM is running.

For Windows VMs, the VMSnapshot extension is installed.
For Linux VMs, the VMSnapshotLinux extension is installed.


- Recovery services Vault
- Go to backup service 
- Choose the workload (Azure --> VM)
- Create a backup policy (how frequently you wana take a backup and define retention period)
- Add the VM 
- Enable the Backup

- Snap --> RSV
